### Image Slider with Smooth Infinite Looping

This project is an elegant and responsive image slider featuring smooth transitions and infinite looping functionality. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the slider is designed to showcase a series of images with a seamless and engaging user experience. Key features include:

- **Smooth Transitions**: The slider uses a cubic-bezier easing function for smooth and natural slide transitions.
- **Infinite Looping**: The slider includes a clever duplication technique to enable continuous looping, allowing users to cycle through the images endlessly without any abrupt jumps.
- **Autoplay Functionality**: The slider automatically progresses through the images at a set interval, enhancing the dynamic feel of the gallery.
- **Navigation Controls**: Two buttons, "Next" and "Previous," provide users with manual control over the image sequence, making it easy to navigate through the slider.
- **Responsive Design**: The slider is fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

This project is ideal for web developers looking to implement a visually appealing and user-friendly image slider in their websites or applications. Whether for showcasing a portfolio, product images, or any other visual content, this image slider offers a polished and professional solution.
